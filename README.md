testapps
========

A repository of applications for testing Cloud Foundry.

This repository will ultimately supplant [vcap-test-assets](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/vcap-test-assets).

It will augment the test assets in the [CATS](https://github.com/pivotal-cf-experimental/cf-acceptance-tests).

It currently contains only broken node apps and introspector, a rails app that reports the contents of its warden container.
